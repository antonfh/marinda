    <h3>We develop kids through music and activity</h3>

    <p>Our focus is the development, from a young age, to learn a new language. Our Aim:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Introducing English to toddlers age 3-5, through music, movement and fun activities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Classes are split up into 3 categories:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Music - Fun songs with lots of movement based around our monthly theme.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Activity/Create - 20 min of creating something, sometimes colouring and drawing and on other days
                    just fun with games and words.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read and Rhyme - We end our class with a rhyme and book of the month.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Why use songs in the primary classroom?</h3>
    <p>
        Songs tend to repetitive and have a strong rhythm. They are easily learnt by primary children and quickly become
        favourites because of their familiarity. They are fun and motivating for children. They allow language to be
        reinforced in a natural context, both with structures and vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
        All songs build confidence in young learners and even shy children will enjoy singing or acting out a song as
        part of a group or whole class. This also develops a sense of class identity. Children are often proud of what
        they have learnt and will like having the opportunity to â€˜show off' what they have learnt to friends or family.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many songs can help develop memory and concentration, as well as physical co-ordination, for example when doing
        the actions for a song. For the teacher, songs can be a wonderful starting point for a topic and can fit in well
        with topics, skills, language and cross-curricular work.
