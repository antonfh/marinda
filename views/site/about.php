    <h3>We develop kids through music and activity</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Introducing English to toddlers age 3-5, through music, movement and fun activities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Classes are split up into 3 categories:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Music - Fun songs with lots of movement based around our monthly theme.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Activity/Create - 20 min of creating something, sometimes colouring and drawing and on other days
                    just fun with games and words.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read and Rhyme - We end our class with a rhyme and book of the month.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
