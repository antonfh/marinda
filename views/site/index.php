            JungoJingle is a great fun and interactive arts and music lesson for 2.5 - 5 year olds.
            The interactive songs will help your child gain confidence and memorise basic English words.
            Music and rhymes also help build and develop memory and coordinating skills in a fun way.

                <p>Having sorted out some technical details, our domain (or actually), domains, are registered and the
                    first draft of the site was created.</p>

                <p>Google started indexing our site at the end of July, 2016. Still under construction, we had to update
                    our About us page to allow for
                    a better indexing with Google</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4">
                <h2 class="font_fp_bold_blue">Top of the list.</h2>

                <p>
                    We are now top of the Google search results (for Jungo Jingle or JungoJingle).
                    Incedently, we are JUNGOJingle not JungleJingle (which returns some Tarzan Jungle Jingles, if you
                    are into
                    that sort of Jingle).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a lot still to do
                    to the site and hope to have regular updates and a new theme soon
