                <p>Having sorted out some technical details, our domain (or actually), domains, are registered and the first draft of the site was created.</p>

                <p>Google started indexing our site at the end of July, 2016. Still under construction, we had to update our About us page to allow for
                a better indexing with Google</p>

                <h2>Top of the list.</h2>

                <p>
                    We are now top of the Google search results (for Jungle Jingle or JungleJingle).
                    </p>
                <p>
                    We have a lot still to do
                to the site and hope to have regular updates and a new theme soon
