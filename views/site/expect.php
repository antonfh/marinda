    <b>Expect LOTS of singing and moving:</b>
    <br />
<p>
    JungoJingle is for fun, fun and more fun.  English is introduced through lots of moving and catchy songs.  We'll throw in a music instrument or two, just to really get all the kids involved.  We want the kids to learn through fun.
</p>

    <p>
    Drawing, sticking, colouring and playing:
</p>
    <p>
    More time for learning while having fun.  Some days we will draw and stick and on other days we will play game songs etc.  Game songs are great for learning directions and commands.  There is one thing kids at JungoJingle can be sure of - FUN, FUN FUN.

    <b>
    READ AND RHYME;
</b>
    <p>
    We end our session with a book and a rhyme.  Our Goodbye song marks the end of the session.
